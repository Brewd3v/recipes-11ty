steps: 
    - Combine the mince and the pesto in a bowl. (I like to add some more salt to the mix)
    - Make patties and cook them in a pan or on the grill. (I like frying them up in butter - take care the olive oil in the pesto can burn and splash)
    - In the mean time prepare the buns with some lettuce, cheese, tomato and onion you can also try out the awesome [magic onions recipe](/recipes/magic-onions).
